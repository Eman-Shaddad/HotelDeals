Description:

	This is a Java Web Application that implements a JSON API consumer to find hotel deals. The user can filter the deals based on destination, date, price and rating. 

Thoughts and work process:

	* I selected Java because it is the language I am most experienced with.
	* I was not familiar with Heroku. I started reading about it to understand what types of applications it hosts and if there are any prequists
	* I was only a little familiar with Maven, so this exercise made me more comfortable using it for building projects
	* I had no experience with JSON, and only knew about JSON objects structure. I learned more about it and how useful it is in integrations and data exchange.
	* I read about jsonAPI and learned how to use it in parsing data retrieved from JSON APIs.
	* I did not use beans because no server side processing is required. We only need to display results. Wrapping the response in beans will consume memory and processing time.
	* I assumed only English and French are possible languages for Offer Info
	* I assuemed minTripStartDate means that the given date is the earliest a trip starts
	* I used scriptlets to disply the data from the JSON Objects. It would have been a better design to use custom tags
	* I am familiar with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned more through practice in this excersie. Although the design is simple, I had a chance to refresh my basic knowledge and put it on practice.
	* This was my first time using GitHub for code revision control.
	* Building and deploying the application on Heroku was also new to me.
